Roguelike in CoffeeScript using rot.js

## Motivation
March 8th, 2014 to March 16th, 2014 is the [7DRL Challenge 2014](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/rec.games.roguelike.development/3DlknWDGPTU).
I intend to submit an entry this year, so I want to get some practice
with [rot.js](https://github.com/ondras/rot.js)

This project is NOT my entry for the 7DRL. Just a warm-up exercise.
